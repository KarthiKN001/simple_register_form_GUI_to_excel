# simple_register_form_GUI_to_excel
Hi everyone, this is a project called "Simple Register Form". Here we can enter the input data of multiple persons which will be exported in to an csv/excel data with Timestamp and UUID for everyone individually.

I have attached 3 files in this repository. you need to download this and kept it together in a single folder.
After that, open that folder in your pythin IDE. 
run -->  register_form.py file.

NOTE:
     Enter the first person's data completely and click the "REGISTER" button once then the data will be saved, And To Add another person's data overwrite the data on that same data fields and enter data completely Then click on the "register" button once again to add the another person's data to excel.Continue for multiple inputs...
     After entering everyone's data close that GUI tab and check the location you have given in the code. 
                         "There will be the excel file with all your input data"
